The biggest problem I see with CMS templating is that people try to use a CMS for something that the CMS wasn't designed to do. I mean, why the hell are you trying to build a custom multi-layout website with a blogging platform? This usually means that you have multiple templates with crazy-ass-long class names like "template-z-section2-with-red-heading" just so you can keep some sort of organization going (until the next guy comes along and goes "WTF!")

brik is to stop the madness. You want to remove the padding? remove that padding class (or add the padding removal class,) you want to change the color? Replace the color class. This give the content authors the ability to make those changes without having to bother you or modifying the core stylesheet.
